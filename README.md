# Mileage Prediction - Regression Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for vehicle mileage using regression analysis. The model aims to establish a mathematical relationship between relevant variables (such as vehicle specifications and driving conditions) and fuel efficiency. This can aid in performance assessment, resource planning, and decision-making for individuals and businesses in the automotive sector.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the YBI Foundation GitHub page.

## Project Steps

### 1. Import Libraries
Ensure the necessary Python libraries are installed and imported. Key libraries include pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.

### 2. Import Data
Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and inspect the first few rows to understand the structure and content of the data.

### 3. Data Exploration
- Examine the data types, unique values, and summary statistics.
- Visualize the relationships between variables using pair plots and regression plots.

### 4. Data Preprocessing
- Check for and handle missing values.
- Drop unnecessary columns and rows with missing data.
- Scale the feature variables to standardize the data.

### 5. Feature Selection
Identify and select the most relevant features for predicting vehicle mileage. Common features include displacement, horsepower, weight, and acceleration.

### 6. Train-Test Split
Split the dataset into training and testing subsets. The training subset is used to train the model, while the testing subset evaluates the model's performance.

### 7. Model Training
Train a linear regression model using the training data. The model learns the relationships between the input features and the target variable (mileage).

### 8. Prediction
Use the trained model to predict mileage on the testing data.

### 9. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and R-squared (RÂ²). These metrics help assess how well the model's predictions match the actual mileage values.
